/**
 * Consumer module - minimal runtime engine for processing messages from Redis Streams
 * 
 * This module provides:
 * - Consumer: Main consumer class for processing messages
 * - StreamReader: Handles Redis Stream reading with proper consumer group management
 * - ConcurrencyPool: Manages concurrent message processing
 * 
 * The Consumer is a minimal "runtime engine" that only handles:
 * - Fetching messages from Redis Streams (new + stuck pending)
 * - Running handlers with concurrency control
 * - ACKing messages after successful processing
 * - Emitting runtime events (started, succeeded, failed)
 * 
 * Policy concerns (retries, delays, cron, state management) are handled in higher layers.
